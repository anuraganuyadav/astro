<h3>What is Marriage Compatibility in Astrology?</h3>
<p>
Astrology studies the horoscope (kundli or birth chart) of individuals to understand their personality, emotional needs, and life patterns. When two charts are compared for marriage, astrologers examine:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Emotional compatibility</strong> ‚Äì Will both partners understand and support each other?</li>
  <li><strong>Communication style</strong> ‚Äì Can they resolve conflicts peacefully?</li>
  <li><strong>Family harmony</strong> ‚Äì Will the relationship bring peace and balance between families?</li>
  <li><strong>Longevity of marriage</strong> ‚Äì Are the planets favorable for a lasting bond?</li>
  <li><strong>Financial and career growth</strong> ‚Äì Will the union bring prosperity?</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is popularly known as <em>Kundli Milan</em> or Horoscope Matching in Vedic astrology.</p>

<h3>Kundli Matching and Ashta Koota Milan</h3>
<p>
One of the most widely used methods in Vedic astrology is the <strong>Ashta Koota Milan</strong> system. It assigns points (guna) based on eight key factors, with a maximum score of 36:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Varna</strong> ‚Äì Spiritual compatibility</li>
  <li><strong>Vashya</strong> ‚Äì Mutual control and influence</li>
  <li><strong>Tara</strong> ‚Äì Health and destiny compatibility</li>
  <li><strong>Yoni</strong> ‚Äì Sexual and physical compatibility</li>
  <li><strong>Graha Maitri</strong> ‚Äì Mental and emotional bonding</li>
  <li><strong>Gana</strong> ‚Äì Nature and temperament matching</li>
  <li><strong>Bhakoot</strong> ‚Äì Financial stability and emotional harmony</li>
  <li><strong>Nadi</strong> ‚Äì Health, heredity, and long-term well-being</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>üëâ A score of 18 or more is generally considered favorable.</strong> Astrologers also check Manglik Dosha, the 7th house of marriage, Venus‚ÄìMoon alignment, and other planetary aspects.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Kundli Matching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prevents future conflicts by identifying potential challenges early</li>
  <li>Strengthens emotional bonding through personality insights</li>
  <li>Supports family harmony between in-laws</li>
  <li>Suggests remedies like mantras, pujas, and gemstones</li>
  <li>Boosts confidence in decision-making for both arranged and love marriages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Astrology Still Matters</h3>
<p>
Modern marriages face stress, busy routines, and changing family dynamics. Horoscope matching helps ensure partners are aligned mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. While love and communication are vital, astrology adds an extra layer of assurance.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Astrology isn‚Äôt superstition ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding the cosmic blueprint of life. Through Kundli matching, horoscope analysis, and remedies, astrology guides couples toward a happy, stable, and prosperous marriage.

<h3>What is Numerology and Name Correction?</h3>
<p>Numerology is the ancient science of numbers that studies how numbers influence human life. Each letter of your name corresponds to a number, and the total sum determines your name number. When your name number is not in sync with your life path number or destiny number, it creates imbalance, struggles, or delays in achievements.</p>
<p>A numerologist makes corrections in spellings or adds/removes letters so the vibrations of the name align with your date of birth, thus improving energy flow in life.</p>

  <li><strong>Financial Prosperity:</strong> Balanced numbers attract wealth, stability, and better financial management.</li>
  <li><strong>Better Relationships:</strong> Harmonized name vibrations improve understanding, love, and harmony in personal and family relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidence &amp; Personality Enhancement:</strong> Many people experience higher self-confidence and stronger decision-making abilities after a numerology-based name correction.</li>
  <li><strong>Health &amp; Well-being:</strong> Positive name vibrations reduce stress, balance energies, and improve overall well-being.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who Should Consider a Name Change?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students facing repeated failures or lack of focus.</li>
  <li>Professionals stuck in career stagnation.</li>
  <li>Business owners wanting brand growth.</li>
  <li>Individuals with relationship or marital issues.</li>
